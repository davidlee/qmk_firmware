# Haegur - a Planck / Preonic layout for power without exertion.

[This layout](layout.txt) takes inspiration shamelessly from many sources (miryoku, callum, seniply, etc). It has evolved over months of daily use, and though it continues to evolve, fits my needs like a glove. If your preferences hew close to mine, it might just be perfect for you too â€“ or a good starting point for your own customisations.

Optimised for:

- Mac OS
- Colemak-DH
- Writing and programming in English (ANSI)
- My own preferences (e.g. left thumb spacebar; right thumb backspace & shift)
- Sharing the same layout across different keyboards without fuss
- In order of precedence:
  - Power
  - Comfort
  - Learnability
  - Implementation simplicity
  - Design minimalism

Design principles:

- Eschew complex customisation. Embrace constraints & strong opinions.
- Nothing is further than one key from the home position. Avoid moving away from it at all where possible.
- Use thumbs heavily.
- Prefer same-thumb layer activation.
- Home row mods are great, and carefully tuned, but can be disabled without making operation difficult.
- Combos are awesome.
- Follow conventions which live in muscle memory, where possible:
  - left thumb for spacebar, from mouse & keyboard games
  - right hand for numpad, from every number pad ever
  - ZXCV positions for undo/cut/copy/paste
  - vim style movement keys (left, down, up, right)
- Sometimes adding flexibility is worth duplication in a layout.

- Recommended with:
  - Raycast, for two-keypress application switching with Meh shortcuts
  - Karabiner, for Fn key support, and mapping functionality like dictation & mission control.
