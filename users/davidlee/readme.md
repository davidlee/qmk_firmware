# David's Planck / Preonic Layout

inspiration taken from many sources (miryoku, callum, seniply, etc).

features & design considerations:

- optimised for: 
  - Mac OS
  - Colemak-DH 
  - writing and programming in English (ANSI)

- consistent, minimal, powerful. Evolved over months of daily use.
- careful utilisation of thumbs:
  - home position covers space/numbers & symbols (left), and backspace/shift (right). 
  - this is the way.
  - tab, cmd, enter, and all layers available within a single key from home position.
  - so is E, if you're into that.
- home row mods:
  - extensively tuned to avoid interference with regular typing. Caveat: home row shift is for combination with other mods, not letter capitalization.
  - easily toggled off, if the slight additional latency is distracting in extended typing sessions.
- more options for modifiers:
  - dedicated mod keys in traditional positions
  - simple home row mod keys on multiple layers
  - consistent with home row mods for consistent muscle memory
- mouse emulation is available as a transient layer, or can be toggled 
- caps word & backspace word
- QWERTY layer for gaming
- easily adapted to Corne form factor (although you lose the dedicated mods). 

- best with:
  - Raycast, in combination with custom `Meh+alpha` shortcuts, for launching applications
  - Karabiner, for Fn key support and mapping F keys to functionality like dictation & mission control  


TODO:
- [ ] implement layer states for CAPS LED -- see keyboards/planck/keymaps/jweickm/keymap.c
- [ ] update planck layout
- [ ] finish implementing wrappers for shared layouts
- [ ] TD on ESC - toggle home row mods.
