# TODO


 - add progamming word case support, refactor shift keys, etc from https://github.com/andrewjrae/kyria-keymap#case-modes
   -  https://github.com/andrewjrae/kyria-keymap/blob/master/features/casemodes.c
 - split keymap into nicer file


 * improve magic shift
   - when you double-tap it then hit an alpha without pausing for the TAPPING_TERM there is no effect.
   - tapping should cancel Caps Lock .. wait, it does if you pause after - same issue again.
   - it just doesn't work that well. needs some tracing & debugging
   


 - FIGURE out how to make tapping SHIFT disable CAPS Lck
 - proper / iterate QWERTY gaming layer
 - Planck compatibility
 - what to do with blanks? try MEH
 - set up dynamic macros on top right key 

# CHANGELOG
 
* swap fn and menu
* add MEH keys on TAB and R0[-1,-2]
