# DLPL â€” David Lee's Preonic Layout

This is largely based on the ideas and principles behind the amazing Miryoku layout, but designed to make more sense to me.

 * I'm optimising wholly for OS X
 * I have large hands so I am pretty comfortable with hitting things with pinkies
 * I've got a bunch of keys and layers available, so I may as well either use them, or reserve them for future use (eg. for snippets, application-specific shortcuts, emoji, etc)
 * use RGB lights to show layer state
 * retain minimalist ethos, but use cool tricks as appropriate (eg. dedicated leader key for configuration, etc)

Status: very much a work in progress, but ready for use.
